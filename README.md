# allstarlink_notifier
Send message to Telegram when somebody connected to AllStarLink node

This very small and easy script is based on n8acl/aslnotify script - aslnotify not worked for me, than i make a own script with less posibility (telegram only) but working for me from first time and do what i expect.

You will need create a own telegram bot and get bot API key and telegram chatID of your chat group. This must be filled inside a script. Than all is working like mad :-)
